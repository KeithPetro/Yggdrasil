# Yggdrasil
Yggdrasil is an open-source self-hosted family tree viewer for the whole family developed using the Django<sup>1</sup> framework. Yggdrasil allows you to share the contents of a GEDCOM<sup>2</sup> file, as well as related media, with family members.

## Vision
This project aims to create a web-accesible family tree viewer in an effort to allow family genealogists to share their findings with their family members easily, fascilitate data collection (allowing family members to suggest changes, point out inaccuracies, send media, send stories, etc). We also hope for this project to be able to generate useful and well formatted reports on the genealogical data it presents.

## Behind the Name
Yggdrasil<sup>3</sup> is the tree of the world from Norse Mythology, connecting all nine worlds. While we may not be able to connect to any other worlds, we hope this project will allow you to connect to your family and share with them your family's own personal history.
